SyDjango Talk, Django Admin: The Missing Manual
===============================================

This repo contains source code for a talk I gave at the monthly
`SyDjango Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/SyDjango/>`_. The talk
covered the Django Admin, some reasons people might not use it,
why you should use it anyway, and how to address some of those
possible issues.

The source code implements models and admin classes for a
basic blog app, where each commit is tagged for each step of
the talk, starting from a vanilla set of models and admin
classes, building up to much more featureful and attractive
admin interface.

Check out my corresponding blog post `Django Admin: The Missing
Manual <http://blog.jupo.org/2012/10/26/sydjango-talk-django-admin-the-missing-manual/>`_,
which contains slides and video for the talk.
